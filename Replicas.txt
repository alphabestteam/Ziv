To add more pods of the backend and frontend of the app,  the replicas field can be changed to the wanted number.
It can also be done with the CLI command:
'kubectl scale deployment frontend-deployment --replicas=3 -n kube1' 
The creation of addition pods helps balance the demand for each part of the app bycreating multiple pods to handle the requests. It should be used when 
the app experiences traffic and when improved performances are needed. For example, if there is a need to pull a lot of data
from the database all at once, it will help if there are multiple pods of the database.
