Readiness probe refers to a Kubernetes mechanism that's used to determine when a container that's in a pod is ready to start accepting traffic.
It plays a key role in ensuring the stability of applications that are in contained environments.
This way, Kubernetes knows when a container is prepared to handle requests.
This feature is valuable for multiple reasons: it allows for smoother deployments and making sure that the container 
is ready and has all of its needed dependencies before it starts accepting traffic.

If the readiness probe is missing, is could cause traffic to pile Up since it's directed ata a container that isn't ready.
This could lead to lost traffic or errors since the container won't handle the requests properly.
