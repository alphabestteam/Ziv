When trying to access the page, the site is unreachable. This is because the port mapping for MongoDB Express isnâ€™t in the docker-compose.yml file. 
docker compose up -d
docker compose down
In order to solve this, the 8081 port must be added to the MongoDB Express service. 
Using an  .env file to store environment variables is a solution for this issue. This makes the code more readable and organizes the variables in a separate file. 
docker compose up -d
