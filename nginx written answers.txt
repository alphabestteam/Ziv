NGINX

NGINX is a web server that can double as a reverse proxy. It is known for its high performance and scalability. It is a free and open-source software, published in 2004. It also helps in load balancing, TLS/SSL encryption handling and termination, and provides a caching mechanism.
Advantages:
 Since it’s also a reverse proxy, it sits in front of web servers. Therefore, Nginx can protect backend servers, protecting against attacks and any external threats, serving as a security barrier. 
 NGINX is very high performing, handling a large number of connections efficiently. It can handle high-traffic websites.
 NGINX has caching capabilities, which reduces the load on backend servers and makes NGINX’s performances more efficient (improves response times).
