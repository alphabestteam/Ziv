The issue with using environmental variables is that it becomes harder to maintain them the more the cluster grows. We will have to make many changes in order to 
change the value of one variable, since they are all spread out. It would be better to use a config map in order to place all the variables in one location.
This is also the more secure option between the two. 

The secure way which I used to add is a secret object which allows me to encrypt the URL.
The command I used is:
echo -n "http://backend-deployment.kube1.svc.cluster.local:8000" | base64
