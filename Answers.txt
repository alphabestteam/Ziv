If a service account isn't manually defined for a pod,
it uses the default service account in the namespace it belongs to.
Service accounts are a very much need tool that 'labels' the processes running in a pod. 
They are used to control API access and permissions to the pods. When a pod needs to interact
with Kubernetes or other external resources, it can use a service account to authenticate 
and authorize its actions.
